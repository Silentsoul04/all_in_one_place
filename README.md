# all_in_one_place

This repo is used to share what I learnt during CTFs, work, courses etc. 

I like to have all the information I need in one place, to search with keywords. I used Joplin to take my notes, so the jex file is also here if you want to import it directly in Joplin. Then simply type ```F6``` to search in all the notes.

Enjoy, share and feel free to comment and contribute !
