CORS

## Theory

- You are allowed to make XMLHttpRequests to domains outside of your origin, but they have special headers to signify where the request originates, what custom headers are added ...
- It's possible to even have it pass the receiving domain's cookies, allowing attackers to potentially compromise logged-in users.
