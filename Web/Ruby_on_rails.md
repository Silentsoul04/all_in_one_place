Ruby on rails

- Ruby-on-Rails enforces "convention" over "configuration" which really helps to guess class names and attributes' name...


## Bypass authorization

- During logging, if you found something like `user[username]` ..., try add new attributes, like user`[admin]=true`, or `user[admin]=1` etc

## Command execution

- Understand the error. Try different escaping characters like `' " `. 
- Command execution between backticks ``
