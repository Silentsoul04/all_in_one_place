SMTP

## Generality
- Mail servers can also be used to gather information about a host or network : ```VRFY``` (asks the server to verify an email address), ```EXPN``` (asks the server for the membership of a mailing list)

- Example : 
```nc -nv <IP> <PORT(25)>```
```HELO domain``` or ```EHLO domain````
```VRFY root```


- You can set local.domain.name or anything you want in ‘HELO’, because the server doesn’t check its authenticity, that is one of the drawbacks of this protocol.
