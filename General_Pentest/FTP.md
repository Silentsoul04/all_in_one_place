## UFW 

Pay attention with ```ufw```
it's not allowing the return of the connection
To resolve that : ```ufw allow from <ip>```

---

## Generality

- Always try anonymous connection

- Windows : ```ftp -i```

- Linux : type ```binary``` when authenticated for the transfer, or it could fail when you want to execute the program on your attacking machine.

- upload a file : before connecting to the ftp, go to the folder where your file is located, then ftp to the server, then ```mput <yourfile>```

## FTP autologin from remote to you

- Wait connection on ```nc -nvlp 21```
- Send : ```220 something```
- You have the user
- Then : ```331 <user> something```
- you have the pass


- or you can simply launch responder :)
