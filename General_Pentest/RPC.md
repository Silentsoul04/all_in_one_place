RPC

## RPC on linux  (port 111)

### Basics

- ```rpcinfo -p <IP>```
- ```showmount -e <IP>```
- ```sudo mount ip:/folder /mnt -vvv```

### RPC v3

- How to know : ```mount | grep <mounted>

- In v3, you can set your uid locally and nfs will respect that. So ```cat /etc/passwd``` on the victim, check the uid, and connect on this mounted nfs with a user who have the same uid as the one on the victim.

- Root, userid 0. There is an option, ```root_squash```, that doesnâ€™t allow root connections over nfs, and rather converts them to nobody. If it is enabled, you'll have permission denied everywhere.
