Tips

## Curl

## Problem with output

When something doesn't appear after trying to execute a payload on a website, try use ```2>&1``` at the end

To test it locally, if you enter ```nc -h >/dev/null``` and you doesn't see output, it's because the output is in standard error (stderr). By default it prints standard ouput (stdout).

## Full tty

[*] To upgrade to fully interactive tty:

- Identify rows and columns :
```

```
Then
```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
OR
```SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null```
OR
```expect -c 'spawn bash; interact'```
THEN
```
CTRL-Z
stty raw -echo
fg
reset
