## Generality

- To identify, there is a user ```memcache```, and the port 11211 is open
- ```telnet 127.0.0.1 11211```
- ```stats``` to print the current statistics information (not very useful)
- ```stats slabs``` (view the total pages to see how many slabs there is/are)
- ```stats items``` to view the number of items. You'll see something like STAT items:1:... this is the id.
- ```stats cachedump 1 0``` 1 for the id previously seen, 0 the number of the key, 0 to dump all.
- Then ```get <item you want>```
