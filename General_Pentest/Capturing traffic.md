Capturing traffic

## Tcpdump 

- ```tcpdump port <port> -X (to see the packet) -s (snaplen,  by default s0, but you can choose the length)```

- Maximum size of an ethernet frame is 1500 so if data is truncated, use that.
```tcpdump -i <interface> â€˜host <ip> and port <port>'```

---
## Netstat (or ss)

- ```netstat -antp | grep <service>```
- ```ss -tunlpn```
