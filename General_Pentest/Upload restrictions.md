- ```mv pic.jpg pic.php.jpg```

## Example : Bypass security filter to upload php instead of other stuff

- If I submit a simple php webshell instead of a picture, it returns “Invalid file”. There is some filtering going on that I’ll need to bypass.

- I’ll find the allowed upload of a PNG in Burp and send it to Repeater. There are three common ways that a website will check for valid file types by comparing them to an allow- or deny-list:

1. File extension
2. Content-Type header
3. Magic bytes

- I’ll start by changing one at a time to see if the site blocks. First, I’ll change the extension to .php. It works.

- If I change the Content-Type header to application/x-php, it blocks it (even with the file name changed back to .png).

- Changing the content doesn’t seem to matter.

- Based on the filter testing, it seems like I can name a file .php and include PHP code, as long as I change the Content-Type header to a valid image.
